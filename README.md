# Giveaway-Galore
A simple web app project where I used GamerPowers giveaway API to find live giveaways.

Use the app page to search for available giveaways with some filter options.

Utilizes local storage to save ui state and store favorites.

Includes a community tab which uses a real-time database firebase, to show what other users have liked.
